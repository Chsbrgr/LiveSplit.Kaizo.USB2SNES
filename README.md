# Installation

- Copy "LiveSplit.USB2SNESSplitter.dll" to your LiveSplit-folder "LiveSplit/Components"
- In Livesplit -> Edit Layoutâ€¦ 
- Add -> Control -> USB2SNES Auto Splitter
- Connect your device via USB with your computer and start QUsb2Snes
- Layout Settings (lower left corner) -> choose tab 'USB2SNES Auto Splitter'
- Click 'Autodetect' next to Device to find your device (if it is not detected, make sure the correct firmware is installed, connection is working and QUsb2Snes is running)
- Config file: Choose the config file corresponding to the hack. A config file works for all categories of a romhack.
- Set correct exits for your splits. Default settings for hacks are level names (followed by (S) for secret exits). Settings can be changed in the config file or through the drop-down menus next to your splits in Layout Settings

**Attention: For a hack to be recognized correctly, the correct Game Name has to be set in LiveSplit (Best done with Autocomplete in 'Edit Splits...')**
